For many decades, existing memory technologies have been successfully scaled
down and improved to achieve higher densities, faster speeds with lower
production costs.  Now, however, the miniaturization level of these
technologies is approaching the physical limits for scalability. This raises
the importance of urgent development of new memory technologies. (Spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM))

Traditionally, disk drives or persistent memory devices were 
employed to overcome DRAM limits. The modern attractive 
option is to use solid-state drives (SSDs). However, even fastest 
SSDs have orders-of-magnitude less bandwidth and higher 
latency than DRAM; also, these devices usually operate data is 
large blocks instead of bytes. (mironov)
