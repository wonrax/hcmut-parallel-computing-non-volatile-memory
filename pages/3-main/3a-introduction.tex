For many decades, existing memory technologies have been successfully scaled
down and improved to achieve higher densities, faster speeds with lower
production costs.  Now, however, the miniaturization level of these
technologies is approaching the physical limits for scalability. This raises
the importance of urgent development of new memory technologies. (Spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM))
